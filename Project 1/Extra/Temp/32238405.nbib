AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death 
      worldwide, and the cancer with the fastest increase in mortality in the United 
      States, with more than 39,000 cases and 29,000 deaths in 2018. As with many 
      cancers, survival is significantly improved by early detection. The median 
      survival of patients with early HCC is >60 months but <15 months when detected at 
      an advanced stage. Surveillance of at-risk patients improves outcome, but fewer 
      than 20% of those at risk for HCC receive surveillance, and current surveillance 
      strategies have limited sensitivity and specificity. Ideally, blood-based 
      biomarkers with adequate sensitivity or specificity would be available for early 
      detection of HCC; however, the most commonly used biomarker for HCC, 
      alpha-fetoprotein, has inadequate performance characteristics. There are several 
      candidate serum proteomic, glycomic, and genetic markers that have gone through 
      early stages of biomarker validation and have shown promise for the early 
      detection of HCC, but these markers require validation in well-curated cohorts. 
      Ongoing prospective cohort studies will permit retrospective longitudinal (phase 
      III biomarker study) validation of biomarkers. In this review, we highlight 
      promising candidate biomarkers and biomarker panels that have completed phase II 
      evaluation but require further validation prior to clinical use.See all articles
